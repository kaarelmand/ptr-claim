{"title": "[Narsis] Vandirelyon Stronghold", "stage": "Unclaimed", "description": "Vandirelyon Chimeri stronghold  south west of Othmura  that is going to be the central piece for the Othmura Mages Guild questline.   This should be a good opportunity for puzzles and various challenges that require magic skills to progress - a collapsed bridge for levitation, a narrow hole for telekinesis, a Daedric sigil gate (see Firewatch Mages Guild).   Kevin 's Othmura Mages Guild  Proposal Doc \u00a0(WIP).   Pralec 's suggestions:     Mages Guild leader wants to lodge an expedition to investigate Vandirelyon, but can't because the surface ruins are occupied by houseless Velothi squatters. Either convince the leaders of Ald Iuval to let the squatters move into their already decrepit and overcrowded town (remember your vows to protect the Waters March), or recruit Hlaalu Guards from the governor of Othmura to clear them out. You can also just kill them yourself, but the guild leader doesn't like it very much.   The front door to Vandirelyon is locked. Expedition leader suggests that the previous tenants might know more about unlocking it. If you relocated them to Ald Iuval you can go talk to them, or otherwise find a journal left in the dome for the information. Turns out one of the younger members of the group had found the key and was sneaking into the stronghold. Worried that this would result in disaster, the eldest member of the group took the key and chucked it in the river. Use Detect Key to find the key, or use Open Lock 100 to unlock the door, or levitate to the roof, go in through the top, and find a key in the interior to unlock the door.   There is a sigil gate in the lower levels of Vandirelyon, preventing deeper access. The expedition leader says that a matching sigil amulet is needed to unlock the gate. Reading some old records in the stronghold will reveal that the amulet was kept in the Propylon Chamber. But when you try to open the Propylon chamber, the door won't budge - there has been a collapse on the other side. You need to find the Propylon index to get into the chamber. There will be hints in the stronghold that the Propylon index is at [Location]   Once you've got the Sigil Amulet, go through the gate. There are some puzzle-y rooms to go through on the lower levels, like a lever on the other side of a room that you need levitation or telekinesis to reach. At the lowest level is a Daedric Artifact that the Expedition Leader wants. When you pick it up, a Dremora Lord is summoned.     Kevin 's reply:     I really like the different obstacles / puzzles you described. Especially the way you use the blocked Propylon Chamber. Thanks for all this inspiration.   I would like to include more Redoran-Hlaalu tension than mentioned here. However, I do agree it should take place in/around the stronghold. Perhaps the overseer simply shows up unannounced. Alternatively, strongly-worded letters might arrive to annoy the mages. Furthermore, making the squatters houseless (instead of vaguely backed by house Hlaalu) removes that sense of Hlaalu encroachment I was hoping to create. In your write-up, it feels like the player can avoid dealing with more than one house entirely. (Maybe that's desired, but it was sort of the inspiration behind this questline for me.)   I liked Q2 as it sets the pace for the quest quite well. In addition to magical exploration, there's a physical barrier (rocks/rubble) that is being removed while the player deals with the obstacles you mentioned. Recruiting miners and getting supplies is also a good excuse to show the player both towns, and have common folk talk about the local tension. These barriers don't need to be grand: they can be as simple as a new trapdoor being uncovered. This also plays into the idea of \"two forces\": Hlaalu/Redoran, Magic/Physical, Mages Guild/Imperial Archaeology Society.   Also, I hope I can keep the finale (Q4) largely the same with the player showing up and finding everyone gone. I wanted the player to feel a sense of dread and surprise. However, I understand if that doesn't work lore-wise. Could a dremora spellcaster trap Gilen and the miners + overseer in another realm temporarily?     P. S.

When you walk in from the outside, the door right in front of you should lead to the Grand Council, and doors on the left and right should lead to a Petitioner\u2019s Hall and a Courtroom respectively.   Grand Council\u2013where the Hlaalu Council meets, it\u2019s a big deal when it\u2019s in use. Right behind the lobby, and is a room that is 3 tiles high (will most likely need a custom mesh so it\u2019s not so squarish). The upper levels should have individual booths for the Councilors. Maybe a balcony ring on the second level, with the main floor at the bottom for speakers.   Petitioner\u2019s Hall\u2013a hall where citizens can present small civil concerns, and general proclamations are made. Main hall is 2 tiles high. Should have a stairwell at the back leading to the top floors.   Courtroom\u2013a full legal court for high-profile trials. Main hall is 2 tiles high. Should have a stairwell at the back leading to the top floors.   The space on top of the ground floor halls (4th floor on top of the Grand Council, 3rd and 4th on top of the flanking halls) includes offices for clerks and lawyers, break rooms, and other things of that nature. There should be general office space for clerks/lawyers with de_m furniture, and then individual offices for the following people (using de_r furniture): Hlaalu Chief Justice, Hlaalu Chief Clerk, Hlaalu City Architect, Hlaalu Chief Inquisitor (prosecutor).     There are 3 towers:     Steward\u2019s Tower\u2013the tower on the left is the residence of the Narsis Grand Council\u2019s Steward. The Steward attends the day-to-day council business such as being the primary Hlaalu questgiver in Narsis and running the Petitioner\u2019s Hall. The lower floors of the tower should have offices for the Steward\u2019s personal clerks and staff. Above that should be office space for the Steward and living quarters. Be sure that the bedroom is not at the very top floor, because without elevators and air conditioning, the lower the better. Instead of a single stairwell with stackable stairs, some spiralling/alternating stair locations would be better.   Vizier\u2019s Tower\u2013the tower on the right is the residence and workplace of the Vizier of Narsis, the Hlaalu Grandmaster\u2019s most trusted adviser. He is essentially a court mage who is also the Hlaalu\u2019s Spymaster. There should be accommodations for one or two sub-viziers near the bottom of the tower, who act as legal experts, spy coordinators, and mystics. The residence of the Vizier above should be fairly open (with some double height rooms), including an office, living quarters, and places for magical study. Instead of a single stairwell with stackable stairs, some spiralling/alternating stair locations would be better.   Bailiff\u2019s Tower\u2013the smaller tower in the center is the residence and workplace of the Hlaalu Bailiff. This is the top Marshal in the city, with the Canyon Watch, River Watch, and Council Guard Captains all reporting to him. Should include an office and a living space.     Sub-Levels should include slave quarters (de_p), some accomodations for clerks and Hlaalu Retainers (not all of the clerks though, as some have houses in St. Veloth Quarter. Use de_m), generic storerooms, and a small kitchen (de_m). One of the storerooms should have a guarded trapdoor that leads to the Council Quarter Sewers. Below all of this should be the Vault (de_r), which is the main Vault of House Hlaalu, glittering with riches (putting aside personal vaults such as the Grandmaster\u2019s).
